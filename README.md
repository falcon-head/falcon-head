<h3 align="center"> ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Shrikrishna.</h3>

I'm a Graduate Student pursuing Master of Science in Computer Software Engineering. I'm immensely passionate about Software Engineering & Development. In addition, I take up anything and everything that I find exciting and pursue relentlessly. I'm a JavaScript fan, but I dabble in Python. That's a lie. I'm a fan of both. You can find me scrolling through my Twitter feed during my free time.
