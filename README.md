<h3 align="center"> ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Shrikrishna.</h3>

Greetings, fellow beings of the internet! I am a Grad Student and a full-fledged fanatic of all things software engineering and development. My love for JavaScript and Python is so intense that it feels like trying to choose between pizza and ice cream â€“ you just can't do it!

When I'm not busy coding, I can be found scrolling through Twitter, following all the latest and greatest software engineering memes and trends. Some may say I have a problem, but I say, "Twitter feeds my soul."

I also havea habit of taking on more projects than I can handle, but let's be real â€“ who needs sleep when you can have endless cups of coffee and a steady stream of challenges?
